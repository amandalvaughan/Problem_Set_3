These are my answers for Problem Set 3.

#1)
def getMinMax(itr):
    i = iter(itr)
    smallest = largest = i.next()
    for number in i:
        if number < smallest:
            smallest = number
        elif number > largest:
            largest = number
    return smallest, largest
    
    this gives the line number of the line with the maximum water level, but not the actual value -- help?

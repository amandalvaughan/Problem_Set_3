These are my answers for Problem Set 3.

#1)

try:
    Data = open('WaterLevelData')
except:
    print("can't open file")
largest = None
date = None
print('Before:', largest)
for line in Data:
    line_bits = line.split(",")
    try:
        water_level = float(line_bits[1])
    except:
        continue
    if largest is None or water_level > largest :
        largest = water_level
        date = line_bits[0]
print(largest)
print(date)

I saved the repo to my computer as WaterLevelData - so if you input your version of the file, should work! :)

#2) [in jupyter notebook]

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_table('WaterLevelData', sep='\t')
df.head()
df['Water Level'].max()
df.loc[df['Water Level'].idxmax()]

I saved the repo to my computer as WaterLevelData, so if you use your version, this should work; it does for me! I can provide a screenshot if necessary!

#3) [in jupyter notebook]

df = pd.read_table('WaterLevelData', sep='\t')
df.head()
max(df['Water Level'].shift(-1)-df['Water Level'])

Gives me the difference!

#4) I am an undergraduate student :)

These are my answers for Problem Set 3.

#1)
b = open('WaterLevelData')

c = b.readlines()
regels = len(c)

print(regels)

max = 0
for line in b.readlines():
  num = int(line.split(",")[0])
  if (max < num):
    max = num 


print(max)

This script gives the line number of the line with the maximum water level, but not the actual value -- help?
